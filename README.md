Placeholder Name is a 3D platformer game with a large focus on jumping and incoporating the two playing styles "exploration" and "speedrunner". As the game slogan above says we attempted to follow a somple narrative with a larger focus on the mechanics of the game.

## Level Structure/ Game Loop
The level design takes influence from a canyon aesthtic with rock themed walls and floors. The whole level is set in a floating scene where falling of the level causes the player to respawn. The level it self was structured around the focus of jumping and jumppads. Starting from the begining of the player spawn point, the level is designed to slowly introduce the player to the controls and any other components the character interacts with in the game. The player is taught the basic traversal moves such as run, sprint, jump, and double jump. Then as the player progresses through the level they are thought about other interactions in the level such as jumppads, boulders, moving platforms, and a jumppad tower. After the player has learnt all the movements he/she are free to explore the world at their own pace. The level is desgined to accompany multiple playing styles as mentioned previously by numerous pathways to destinations, which affect the travel times.
