Placeholder Name is a 3D platformer game with a large focus on jumping and incoporating the two playing styles "exploration" and "speedrunner". As the game slogan above says we attempted to follow a somple narrative with a larger focus on the mechanics of the game.

## Level Structure/ Game Loop
The level design takes influence from a canyon aesthtic with rock themed walls and floors. The whole level is set in a floating scene where falling of the level causes the player to respawn. The level it self was structured around the focus of jumping and jumppads. Starting from the begining of the player spawn point, the level is designed to slowly introduce the player to the controls and any other components the character interacts with in the game.
