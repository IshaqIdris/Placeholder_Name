Placeholder Name is a 3D platformer game with a large focus on jumping and incoporating the two playing styles "exploration" and "speedrunner". As the game slogan above says we attempted to follow a somple narrative with a larger focus on the mechanics of the game.

## Level Structure/ Game Loop
The level design takes influence from a canyon aesthtic with rock themed walls and floors. The whole level is set in a floating scene where falling of the level causes the player to respawn. The level it self was structured around the focus of jumping and jumppads. Starting from the begining of the player spawn point, the level is designed to slowly introduce the player to the controls and any other components the character interacts with in the game. The player is taught the basic traversal moves such as run, sprint, jump, and double jump. Then as the player progresses through the level they are thought about other interactions in the level such as jumppads, boulders, moving platforms, and a jumppad tower. After the player has learnt all the movements he/she are free to explore the world at their own pace. The level is desgined to accompany multiple playing styles as mentioned previously by numerous pathways to destinations, which affect the travel times.

# HOW TO PLAY

**NOTE:** Require a PS3 Controller

**What to do in game?** Explore and roam around freely!

**SETUP**: Open the build program called "Placeholder_Name", set a resolution to match ur screen, and run in "Windows mode". Game should then play automatically.

### Controls:
- Left analog stick -> Movement Controls - Pressure Sensitive for the speed
- Right analog stick -> Camera Movement 
- "x" -> Jump/double jump

### Challenging aspect
**GAME CHALLENGE:**

- Getting to the Jumppad tower and being able to scale up it and traverse all the way back down to the spawn point using the little floating islands. Avoid falling of the level, otherwise you respawn at the begining.

**TECHNICAL CHALLENGES:**

- Creating the fluid gameplay especially the jumping and air play with the jumppads. This was challenging as we wanted to have the controls very sensitive to user input without being jittery. Initial player controllers were too floaty and didn't feel attached to the controller and also did not match the pace of the level and gameplay itself. This consisted of numerous hours of tweaking, variations on jumpad strengths and multiple gravitational changes depending on the height and action performed by the player.
